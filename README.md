Originally was just a simple meatwad themed discord bot with the purpose of having a music bot on the server.

The following dependencies must be downloaded:
FFMPEG
discord.py
youtube_dl

Basic setup:
Make sure to replace BOT_TOKEN with your personal bot token.
meatwad() can be repurposed to play songs from local directories (originally would play meatwad sound clips)
